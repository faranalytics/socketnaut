# *Redirect connections to an HTTP Service to an HTTPS Service.* <sup><sup>(example)</sup></sup>

In this example you will create an HTTP Service and a HTTPS Service.

The endpoint i.e., `/`, runs a for loop that blocks for 100ms on each request.

```js
for (let now = Date.now(), then = now + 100; now < then; now = Date.now()); // Block for 100 milliseconds.
```
## Requirements
Please make sure your firewall is configured to allow connections on `0.0.0.0:3000` for this example to work.
