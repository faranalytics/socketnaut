# *Redirect HTTP connections to an HTTPS server.*

In this example you will create an HTTP Service and a HTTPS Service.  The HTTP server will redirect all requests to the HTTPS server.

`index.ts`

This is the main thread.  A `ServiceProxy` is instantiated for each of the HTTP and HTTPS servers.
```ts
import * as net from 'node:net';
import { createServiceProxy, Level } from 'socketnaut';

const http_proxy = createServiceProxy({
    server: net.createServer(), // Configure this TCP Server however you choose.
    minWorkers: 4,
    maxWorkers: 42,
    workerURL: new URL('./http_server.js', import.meta.url)
});

http_proxy.log.setLevel(Level.DEBUG);

http_proxy.server.listen({ port: 3080, host: '0.0.0.0' });

const https_proxy = createServiceProxy({
    server: net.createServer(), // Configure this TCP Server however you choose.
    minWorkers: 4,
    maxWorkers: 42,
    workerURL: new URL('./https_server.js', import.meta.url)
});

https_proxy.server.listen({ port: 3443, host: '0.0.0.0' });
```

`http_server.ts`

The HTTP server will redirect requests to the HTTPS server listening on port 3443. 
```ts
import * as http from 'node:http';
import { Level, createServiceAgent } from 'socketnaut';

const server = http.createServer(); // Configure this HTTP server however you choose.

server.listen({ port: 0, host: '127.0.0.1' });
// Specifying port 0 here will cause the Server to listen on a random port.
// Socketnaut will communicate the random port number to the ServiceProxy.

server.on('request', (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
    if (req.url) {
        const url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`);
        res.writeHead(301, { 'location': `https://${url.hostname}:3443${url.pathname}` }).end();
        console.log(`Request: ${url}`);
    }
});

const agent = createServiceAgent({ server });
```

`https_server.ts`

The HTTPS server endpoint i.e., `/`, runs a for loop that blocks for 100ms on each request and returns the string "Hello, World!".
```ts
import * as http from 'node:http';
import * as https from 'node:https';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as os from 'os';
import * as pth from 'path';
import { createServiceAgent } from 'socketnaut';

const server = https.createServer(
    {
        key: fs.readFileSync(pth.resolve(os.homedir(), 'secrets/key.pem')),
        cert: fs.readFileSync(pth.resolve(os.homedir(), 'secrets/crt.pem'))
    }); // Configure this HTTPS server however you choose.

server.on('request', (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
    for (let now = Date.now(), then = now + 100; now < then; now = Date.now()); // Block for 100 milliseconds.
    res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen({ port: 0, host: '127.0.0.1' });
// Specifying port 0 here will cause the Server to listen on a random port.
// The Socketnaut Agent will communicate the randomly selected port to the ServiceProxy.

const agent = createServiceAgent({ server });
```

## Requirements

Please make sure your firewall is configured to allow connections on `0.0.0.0:3080` and `0.0.0.0:3443` for this example to work.

## Run the Example

### Instructions

#### Clone the Socketnaut repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faranalytics/socketnaut.git
```

#### Change directory into the relevant example directory.

```bash
cd socketnaut/examples/redirect_http_to_https
```

#### Install the example dependencies.

```bash
npm install && npm update
```

#### Build the TypeScript application.

```bash
npm run clean:build
```

#### Specify a `key.pem` and `cert.pem`.

The HTTPS server is configured to read a `key.pem` and `cert.pem` from the `./ssl/` directory.  However, you can configure it however you choose.

`https_server.ts`

```js
...
const server = https.createServer(
    {
        key: fs.readFileSync(KEY_PATH),
        cert: fs.readFileSync(CERT_PATH)
    });
...
```
Alternatively, if you have `openssl` installed, you can generate the credentials using the `prep` script.
```bash
npm run prep
``` 

#### Run the application.

```bash
npm start
```

#### Test the HTTP redirect using your browser.

If you're using the self-signed certificate generated by the `prep` script you will see a warning.  If you're using your domain's certificate, adjust the domain name accordingly.
```bash
http://localhost:3080
```

#### In another shell send 1000 requests to the HTTP endpoint.

If you're using your domain's certificate, adjust the domain name accordingly.
```bash
time for fun in {1..1000}; do echo "http://localhost:3080"; done | xargs -n1 -P1000 curl -k -L 
```

##### Output

1000 concurrent requests were processed; each request blocked for 100ms. Please see the `https_server.ts` module for detail.
```bash
real    0m12.281s
user    0m16.016s
sys     0m6.832s
```
