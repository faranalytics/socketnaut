# _Redirect HTTP Connections to an HTTPS Server_

## Introduction

In this example you will create an HTTP Service and a HTTPS Service. The HTTP server will redirect all requests to the HTTPS server.

## Implementation

`index.ts`

This is the main thread. A `ServiceProxy` is instantiated for each of the HTTP and HTTPS servers.

```ts
import * as net from "node:net";
import { createServiceProxy, Level } from "socketnaut";

const http_proxy = createServiceProxy({
  server: net.createServer(), // Configure this TCP Server however you choose.
  minWorkers: 4,
  maxWorkers: 42,
  workerURL: new URL("./http_server.js", import.meta.url),
});

http_proxy.log.setLevel(Level.DEBUG);

http_proxy.server.listen({ port: 3080, host: "0.0.0.0" });

const https_proxy = createServiceProxy({
  server: net.createServer(), // Configure this TCP Server however you choose.
  minWorkers: 4,
  maxWorkers: 42,
  workerURL: new URL("./https_server.js", import.meta.url),
});

https_proxy.server.listen({ port: 3443, host: "0.0.0.0" });
```

`http_server.ts`

The HTTP server will redirect requests to the HTTPS server listening on port 3443.

```ts
import * as http from "node:http";
import { Level, createServiceAgent } from "socketnaut";

const server = http.createServer(); // Configure this HTTP server however you choose.

server.listen({ port: 0, host: "127.0.0.1" });
// Specifying port 0 here will cause the Server to listen on a random port.
// Socketnaut will communicate the random port number to the ServiceProxy.

server.on("request", (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
  if (req.url) {
    const url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`);
    res
      .writeHead(301, {
        location: `https://${url.hostname}:3443${url.pathname}`,
      })
      .end();
    console.log(`Request: ${url}`);
  }
});

const agent = createServiceAgent({ server });
```

`https_server.ts`

The HTTPS server endpoint i.e., `/`, runs a for loop that blocks for 100ms on each request and returns the string "Hello, World!".

```ts
import * as http from "node:http";
import * as https from "node:https";
import * as fs from "fs";
import { Level, createServiceAgent } from "socketnaut";
import { CERT_PATH, KEY_PATH } from "./paths.js";

const server = https.createServer({
  key: fs.readFileSync(KEY_PATH),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(CERT_PATH),
}); // Configure this HTTPS server however you choose.

server.on("request", (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
  for (let now = Date.now(), then = now + 100; now < then; now = Date.now()); // Block for 100 milliseconds.
  res.end("Hello, World!");
});

server.listen({ port: 0, host: "127.0.0.1" });
// Specifying port 0 here will cause the Server to listen on a random port.
// The Socketnaut Agent will communicate the randomly selected port to the ServiceProxy.

const agent = createServiceAgent({ server });
```

## Run the Example

### Requirements

Please make sure your firewall is configured to allow connections on `0.0.0.0:3080` and `0.0.0.0:3443` for this example to work.

### Instructions

#### Clone the repository and run the example.

Clone the Socketnaut repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faranalytics/socketnaut.git
```

Change directory into the relevant example directory.

```bash
cd socketnaut/examples/redirect_http_to_https
```

Install the example dependencies.

```bash
npm install && npm update
```

Build the TypeScript application.

```bash
npm run clean:build
```

Specify a `key.pem` and `cert.pem`.

The HTTPS server is configured to read a `key.pem` and `cert.pem` from the `./ssl/` directory. However, you can configure it however you choose.

`https_server.ts`

```js
...
const server = https.createServer(
    {
        key: fs.readFileSync(KEY_PATH),
        cert: fs.readFileSync(CERT_PATH)
    });
...
```

Alternatively, if you have `openssl` installed, you can generate the credentials using the `prep` script.

```bash
npm run prep
```

Run the application.

```bash
npm start
```

#### Test the HTTP redirect using your browser.

If you're using the self-signed certificate generated by the `prep` script you will see a warning. If you're using your domain's certificate, adjust the domain name accordingly.

```bash
http://localhost:3080
```

#### Test the HTTP redirect from the command line.

In another shell send 1000 requests to the HTTP endpoint. If you're using your domain's certificate, adjust the domain name accordingly.

```bash
time for fun in {1..1000}; do echo "http://localhost:3080"; done | xargs -n1 -P1000 curl -k -L
```

#### Output

One thousand concurrent requests were processed; each request blocked for 100ms. Please see the `https_server.ts` module for detail.

```bash
real    0m12.281s
user    0m16.016s
sys     0m6.832s
```
