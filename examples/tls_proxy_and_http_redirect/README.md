# _A TLS Proxy and an HTTP Redirect_

## Introduction

In this advanced example the proxy is a TLS server. You will create two services:

- An HTTP Service that redirects to a secure TLS Service
- A secure TLS Service that manages a pool of HTTP servers

## Implementation

`index.ts`

```ts
...

const tlsServer = tls.createServer({
    key: fs.readFileSync(KEY_PATH),
    cert: fs.readFileSync(CERT_PATH)
}); // Configure this TLS server however you choose.

tlsServer.listen({ port: 3443, host: '0.0.0.0' });

// Create a Service Proxy for handling HTTPS requests.
const tlsProxy = createServiceProxy({
    server: tlsServer,
    minWorkers: 4,
    maxWorkers: 42,
    workerURL: new URL('./service.js', import.meta.url)
});
...
```

The endpoint i.e., `/`, runs a for loop that blocks for 100ms on each request, logs the proxy socket tuple, and echoes the message body.

`service.ts`

```js
import * as http from "node:http";
import { createServiceAgent } from "socketnaut";

const server = http.createServer(); // Configure this HTTP Server however you choose.

server.listen({ port: 0, host: "127.0.0.1" });
// Specifying port 0 here will cause the Server to listen on a random port.
// The Socketnaut Agent will communicate the randomly selected port to the ServiceProxy.

const agent = createServiceAgent({ server });

server.on(
  "request",
  async (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
    for (let now = Date.now(), then = now + 100; now < then; now = Date.now()); // Block for 100 milliseconds.
    const proxyAddressInfo = await agent.requestProxySocketAddressInfo(
      req.socket
    );
    console.log(proxyAddressInfo);
    req.pipe(res);
  }
);
```

## Run the Example

### Requirements

Please make sure your firewall is configured to allow connections on `0.0.0.0:3080` and `0.0.0.0:3443` for this example to work.

### Instructions

#### Clone the repository and run the example.

Clone the Socketnaut repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faranalytics/socketnaut.git
```

Change directory into the relevant example directory.

```bash
cd socketnaut/examples/tls_proxy_and_http_redirect
```

Install the example dependencies.

```bash
npm install && npm update
```

Build the TypeScript application.

```bash
npm run clean:build
```

Specify a `key.pem` and `cert.pem`.

The HTTPS server is configured to read a `key.pem` and `cert.pem` from the `./ssl/` directory. However, you can configure it however you choose.

`index.ts`

```js
...
const tlsServer = tls.createServer({
    key: fs.readFileSync(KEY_PATH),
    cert: fs.readFileSync(CERT_PATH)
}); // Configure this TLS server however you choose.
...
```

Alternatively, if you have `openssl` installed, you can generate the credentials using the `prep` script.

```bash
npm run prep
```

Run the application.

```bash
npm start
```

#### Test the HTTP redirect using your browser.

If you're using the self-signed certificate generated by the `prep` script you will see a warning. If you're using your domain's certificate, adjust the domain name accordingly.

```bash
http://localhost:3080
```

#### Test the HTTP redirect from the command line.

In another shell send 1000 requests to the HTTP endpoint. If you're using your domain's certificate, adjust the domain name accordingly.

```bash
time for fun in {1..1000}; do echo "http://localhost:3080"; done | xargs -n1 -P1000 curl -k -L
```

#### Output

One thousand concurrent requests were processed; each request blocked for 100ms. Please see the `service.ts` module for detail.

```bash
real    0m9.117s
user    0m7.156s
sys     0m4.194s
```
